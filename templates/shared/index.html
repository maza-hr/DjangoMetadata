            <p>This website is a prototype being developed to manage data-related information. It encompasses the structure of the pipeline, representing the flow of data processing from collection to making it available to development teams.</p>

            <p>Its primary goal is to record and oversee all data manipulations, highlighting transformation and organization stages, and any modifications made before they are used by development teams in their projects.</p>
            
            <p>As a secondary objective, it serves as a laboratory to experiment with open-source tools for metadata registration, manipulation, and storage routines, aiming to expand these practices to other departments.</p>
            
            <ul>Next steps:</ul>
            
            <li>Adapt database models to fully comply with the practices defined in ISO 19115:2014 (International) and the MGB 2.0 profile (Brazil).</li>
            <li>Include functionality for locating external data.</li>
